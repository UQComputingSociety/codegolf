      <h4>What is code-golf?</h4>
      <p>
        Code-golf is the art of making computer programmes as small as possible.
        Its name echoes the game of golf in which the aim is to win with as few strokes as possible.
        In code-golf, the winner is the person whose program fulfills the requirements with the least bytes of source code.
      </p>

      <h4>How does the competition work?</h4>
      <p>
        Every 2 weeks we'll give you a challenge
        &mdash; typically consisting of a set of inputs and the rules to transform them into desired outputs
        (don't worry, we won't make you do GUIs).
        Then you'll have 2 weeks to come up with a solution in the language of your choice, and to make it as small as possible.
        You can submit as many times as you, so feel free to experiment.
        At the end, we'll check that your solution works, and count the number of bytes it takes.
        We'll then update the overall scoreboard, and the scoreboard for each language.
      </p>

      <h4>What're the rules?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Your submission must be your original work</li>
        <li>Your submission must pass the provided tests to be considered</li>
        <li>The judges' word is final</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>What can I win?</h4>
